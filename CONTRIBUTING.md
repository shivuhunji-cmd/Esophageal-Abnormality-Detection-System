## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Esophageal-Abnormality-Detection-System.git
cd Esophageal-Abnormality-Detection-System

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/shivuhunji-cmd/Esophageal-Abnormality-Detection-System.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for your feature/fix
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features and consistent formatting
- **HTML/CSS**: Use semantic HTML and organized CSS
- **Comments**: Write clear, helpful comments for complex logic
- **Docstrings**: Include docstrings for all functions and classes

### Example Code Style

```python
def preprocess_image(image_path, target_size=(224, 224)):
    """
    Preprocess medical image for model inference.

    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file
        target_size (tuple): Target size for resizing (width, height)

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Preprocessed image array
    """
    # Load and preprocess image
    image = load_img(image_path, target_size=target_size)
    image_array = img_to_array(image)
    return np.expand_dims(image_array, axis=0) / 255.0
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Test medical image processing thoroughly
- Ensure web interface works across browsers
- Validate model predictions with known datasets

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_model.py
```
